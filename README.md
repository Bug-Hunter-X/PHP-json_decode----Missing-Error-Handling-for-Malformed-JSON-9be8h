This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in PHP when using the `json_decode()` function.  The `bug.php` file showcases code vulnerable to malformed JSON data, without proper error handling. This can lead to unexpected outputs or even application crashes if the malformed JSON is not handled gracefully. The solution, shown in `bugSolution.php`, implements robust error handling using `json_last_error()` to identify and report JSON decoding errors, preventing unexpected crashes and making the code more robust. The example focuses on a missing closing brace in JSON input, but the principle applies to other types of JSON errors.
